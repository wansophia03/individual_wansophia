		<p> My journey as a student begin at Sekolah Kebangsaan Titi Gantong, from 2008 till 2013. Then I continues my secondary school at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Seri Londang, from 2014 until I finish my SPM on 2018. As for my primary school I couldn't find any information 
		that I could say about that school so I just link the school facebook if you want to see about SKTG. SMKSL which is my secondary school is a new school that opened at the beginning of 2013 I think, so when I started school it still new. </p>

		<p>After spm, my result at that time was not that good. so I didn't get an offer to go to university. after that, my school counselor suggested to apply for a pre -diploma. 
		The Pre-Diploma program is offered to anyone with a result of less than 5 credits which makes the student ineligible to continue their studies to the Diploma level. 
		So the result, the application I made was accepted and I got the program offered at UiTM Perak Branch Campus Seri Iskandar. This pre -diploma program ran for 6 months and after that I got the opportunity to apply to university with a pointer of 3.48. 
		So that's how I got a library management course at UiTM Kedah and currently on my last semester.</p>

    <td> I used to be a unapproacable in secondary school bcause i not a smiley type. 
	But every once in a while, some of my friends or junior would smile and say something nice. 
	It made me feel like i was on top of the world. you probably burn one-tenth od a calorie by smiling and complimenting someone.
	It takes cery little effort from you and yet it can make someone's day. 
	After that, i try it at some kids i meet at driving schools and say that her outfit was cool and she literally smiling from ear to ear. 
	Be a smiling hero for someone today.</td>
